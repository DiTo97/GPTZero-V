# GPTZero-V

A simple attempt at a heuristic GPTZero algorithm for the detection of images generated by AI models from metadata.

## overview

With AI-generated imagery becoming more widespread, verifying the authenticity of digital media is increasingly important. The release of GPT-4o for image generation by OpenAI has raised even more concerns on the necessity for stricter authenticity measures. This Streamlit app helps assess whether an image was AI-generated or captured by a physical device using metadata analysis, checking for:

- **C2PA Metadata**: Most AI image generation providers, inclusing OpenAI, are leveraging the C2PA standard for content authenticity and watermarking. Presence of C2PA data from the providers suggests the image is flagged as likely AI-generated.
- **EXIF Metadata**: Presence of EXIF data suggests the image was captured by a device.
- **AI Probability Score**: A heuristic estimate (0-100%) based on metadata findings.

This project explores an alternative approach to deep-learning-based AI image detection, relying on embedded metadata rather than visual cues. The goal is to raise awareness about media validity and encourage more robust authentication mechanisms beyond just training detection models.

## usage

ensure you have uv as package manager. Then:

```shell
uv run streamlit run app.py
```

Then, upload an image to analyze its metadata and AI-generation probability.

## limitations

- **Metadata can be manipulated**, reducing reliability and their presence is never a guarantee of the source.
- **Not all watermarking methods are covered** (e.g., Google's SynthID is unsupported).
- **AI probability is heuristic**, meant for demonstration purposes only.
- **More image generation providers should be checked in the C2PA metadata** (currently only OpenAI).

## call to action

As AI-generated content becomes more sophisticated, it is crucial to implement stronger verification methods. Metadata analysis is just one piece of the puzzle. Future efforts should explore cryptographic verification, provenance tracking, and standardizing authenticity indicators at an industry-wide level.
